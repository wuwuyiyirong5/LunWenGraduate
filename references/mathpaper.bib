  abstract = {{Serially repeated pattern elements on butterfly wings offer the opportunity
	for integrating genetic, developmental, and functional aspects towards
	understanding morphological diversification and the evolution of
	individuality. We use captive populations of Bicyclus anynana butterflies,
	an emerging model in evolutionary developmental biology, to explore
	the genetic and developmental basis of compartmentalized changes
	in eyespot patterns. There is much variation for different aspects
	of eyespot morphology, and knowledge about the genetic pathways and
	developmental processes involved in eyespot formation. Also, despite
	the strong correlations across all eyespots in one butterfly, B.
	anynana shows great potential for independent changes in the size
	of individual eyespots. It is, however, unclear to what extent the
	genetic and developmental processes underlying eyespot formation
	change in a localized manner to enable such individualization. We
	use micromanipulations of developing wings to dissect the contribution
	of different components of eyespot development to quantitative differences
	in eyespot size on one wing surface. Reciprocal transplants of presumptive
	eyespot foci between artificial selection lines and controls suggest
	that while localized antagonistic changes in eyespot size rely mostly
	on localized changes in focal signal strength, concerted changes
	depend greatly on epidermal response sensitivities. This potentially
	reflects differences between the signal-response components of eyespot
	formation in the degrees of compartmentalization and/or the temporal
	pattern of selection. We also report on the phenotypic analysis of
	a number of mutant stocks demonstrating how single alleles can affect
	different eyespots in concert or independently, and thus contribute
	to the individualization of serially repeated traits.}},
