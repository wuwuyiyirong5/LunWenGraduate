As for Euler iteration (\ref{it:EM}), we have also the similar
results on the residual relation. We begin with two key lemmas as
follows.



Define function $\phi$ by
\begin{equation}
\label{fun:phi(t)} \phi(t) = 1 - u(t)^p(1 - t), \ \ |t| < \frac{p}{p
- 1}(\sqrt{2p - 1} - 1),\ \ p \geq 2,
\end{equation}
where $u(t)$ is defined by (\ref{fun:u(t)}), we have




\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:RatFunTayExp} The Taylor expansion of the function
$\phi(t)$ defined by $(\ref{fun:phi(t)})$ has the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:phi(t)_series_form} \phi(t) = \sum_{j = 3}^\infty c_j t^j,
\ \ |t| < \frac{p}{p - 1}(\sqrt{2p - 1} - 1),
\end{equation}
where the coefficients $c_j > 0$ for all $j \geq 3$ and $\sum_{j =
3}^\infty c_j = 1$.
\end{lemma}
